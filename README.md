# kids-clothes
A project to try and quantify the differences in animals on boys' and girls' clothes.

### Introduction

What animals do you associate with boys' clothes? Or girls' clothes? Strangely you don't have to think too long or hard to find examples for each. Cats? Well, that's a girl animal isn't it? Dinosaurs? Those are for little boys.

This project doesn't answer why that's the case. Instead it attempts to put some numbers to the problem.

I've been surprised in the past by how strong confirmation bias can be for things that you think are intuitively true. Like, does Radio X really play the Stone Roses all the time? It turns out, no not really (a previous half-done project of mine). So is it really true that you only ever find certain animals on boys' or girls' clothes? Can we measure just how big the divide is, if there is one at all?

Just a disclaimer from the outset: I don't think there even should be girls' clothes or boys' clothes; there should just be kids' clothes.

### Methods

I wrote several functions to scrap the websites of some of the top retailers of kids' clothes in the UK (I haven't looked at international retailers because I'm based in the UK and I'm not swimming in free time).
